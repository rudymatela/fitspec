FitSpec
=======

Find minimal and complete sub-sets of properties
describing a Haskell program
using black-box mutation testing.

**This a work in progress: currently in very early stage**

Two versions are being developed in parallel
(I haven't decided which is the best yet):

	* [Black](black): black-box functions under test, black-box properties;
	* [White](white): black-box functions under test, white-box properties.

See each respective folder.
