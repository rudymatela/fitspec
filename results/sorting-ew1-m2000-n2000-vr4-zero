./bench/sorting -ew1 -m2000 -n2000 -vr4
Apparent complete but non-minimal specification based on
2000 test cases for each of properties 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
for each of 2000 mutant variations.

Property          #Survivors   Smallest or simplest
 sets              (%Killed)    surviving mutant

{6} {1,4} {1,5}   0 (100%)

{1,2,3}           6 (99%)      \xs -> case xs of
                                        [0,0,1] -> [0,1,1]
                                        _ -> sort xs

{4} {5}           8 (99%)      \xs -> case xs of
                                        [0,1] -> [1,0]
                                        _ -> sort xs

{2,3}             26 (98%)     \xs -> case xs of
                                        [0,1] -> [1,0]
                                        _ -> sort xs

Conjectures:
{4}  =  {5}       99% killed  (weak)
{4} ==> {2,3}     99% killed  (weak)
{6}  =  {1,4}     100% killed (very weak)
