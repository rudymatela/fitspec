./bench/sorting -eint -m4000 -n10000 -vr4
Apparent complete but non-minimal specification based on
10000 test cases for each of properties 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
for each of 4000 mutant variations.

Property            #Survivors   Smallest or simplest
 sets                (%Killed)    surviving mutant

{6} {1,5} {1,2,4}   0 (100%)

{1,4}               2 (99%)      \xs -> case xs of
                                          [-3] -> []
                                          _ -> sort xs

{1,2,3}             3 (99%)      \xs -> case xs of
                                          [0,0,1] -> [0,1,1]
                                          _ -> sort xs

{5} {2,4}           10 (99%)     \xs -> case xs of
                                          [0,1] -> [1,0]
                                          _ -> sort xs

Conjectures:
{4} ==> {3}       99% killed  (weak)
{5}  =  {2,4}     99% killed  (weak)
{6}  =  {1,5}     100% killed (very weak)
